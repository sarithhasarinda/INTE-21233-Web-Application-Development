	<p>Cybersecurity is the protection to defend internet-connected devices and services from malicious attacks by hackers, spammers, and cybercriminals. The practice is used by companies to protect against phishing schemes, ransomware attacks, identity theft, data breaches, and financial losses.</p>

	<p>Look around today's world, and you'll see that daily life is more dependent on technology than ever before. The benefits of this trend range from near-instant access to information on the Internet to the modern conveniences provided by smart home automation technology and concepts like the Internet of Things.</p>

	<p>Cyber security has been used as a catch-all term in the media to describe the process of protection against every form of cybercrime, from identity theft to international digital weapons. These labels are valid, but they fail to capture the true nature of cyber security for those without a computer science degree or experience in the digital industry.</p>

         <tr>
            <td>Malware</td>
            <td>Malware is when an unwanted piece of programming or software installs itself on a target system, causing unusual behavior. This ranges from denying access to programs, deleting files, stealing information, and spreading itself to other systems.</td>
            <td> organizations should have the latest anti-malware programs installed, for starters. It’s also important to recognize suspicious links, files, or websites, which are effective ways of implementing malware. Often, a combination of caution and anti-virus is enough to thwart most malware concerns</td>
         </tr>
         <tr>
            <td>Password Theft</td>
            <td>A common conclusion when you log in to an account, only to find your password changed and details lost. The reality is an unwanted third party managed to steal or guess your password and has since run amok with the information. It’s far worse for an enterprise, which may lose sensitive data.</td>
            <td>Two-factor authentication is a robust protection method, as it requires an additional device to complete the login. Additionally, using complicated logins thwarts brute force attempts.</td>
         </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Traffic Interception</td>
            <td>Also known as “eavesdropping,” traffic interception occurs when a third-party “listens” to info sent between a user and host. The kind of information stolen varies based on traffic but is often used to take log-ins or valuable data.</td>
            <td>Avoiding compromised websites (such as those not using HTML5) is an excellent proactive defense. Encrypting network traffic – such as through a VPN – is another preventive method</td>
         </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Phishing Attacks</td>
            <td>Phishing scams are an older attack method and rely on social engineering to achieve its goal. Typically, an end user receives a message or email which requests sensitive data, such as a password. Sometimes, the phishing message appears official, using legitimate appearing addresses and media. This compels an individual to click on links and accidentally give away sensitive information.</td>
            <td>Generally, a common-sense approach to security is the best prevention. Phishing messages are often rife with spelling and syntax errors. Official emails from organizations do not request personal data, so this is a giveaway there is malicious inten</td>
         </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>DDoS</td>
            <td>Distributed Denial of Service is an attack method in which malicious parties target servers an overload them with user traffic. When a server cannot handle incoming requests, the website it hosts shuts down or slows to unusable performance.</td>
            <td>Stopping a DDoS requires identifying malicious traffic and halting access. This can take time depending on how many malicious IP’s are used to distribute the attack.  In most cases, servers need to be taken offline for maintenance.</td>
         </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Ransomware</td>
            <td>A nasty variant of malware, ransomware installs itself on a user system or network. Once installed, it prevents access to functionalities (in part or whole) until a “ransom” is paid to third parties.</td>
            <td>Removal is challenging once installed. Keeping anti-virus updated and avoiding malicious links are the best current prevention methods. Also, current backups and replications are key to keeping ransomware attacks from becoming catastrophic.</td>
         </tr>
         <tr>
            <td>Trojan Virus</td>
            <td>Trojan malware attempts to deliver its payload by disguising itself as legitimate software. One technique used was an “alert” a user’s system was compromised by malware, recommending a scan, whereby the scan actually delivered the malware.</td>
            <td>Avoid downloading programs or executable from unrecognized vendors or those that attempt to alarm the user to a serious problem.</td>
